# Sweet Dreams

## Purpose
 - This branch of the "Sweet Dreams" repo is solely for storing alternative versions of the audio files that make up the program.
 - Particularly, all files are available in their original state to make it easier to redo the audio effects as new processes become available.

## Directory Guide:
 - `raw-total` - all the files in their completely original states, as found in their original sources. Literally nothing has been touched.
